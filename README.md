## About
I’m a UX/UI designer who builds interfaces that feel clear, accessible, and human. I work at the intersection of design, research, and data, and I’m especially interested in accessibility, multilingual and localized UX, and human-robot interaction.

Right now, I’m focused on interaction design and usability testing, translating messy requirements into simple flows that are easy to understand and easy to use.
